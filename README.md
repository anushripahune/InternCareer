# InternCareer
Task1 - Setup Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline
1. Setup Jenkins:

a. Install Jenkins on a virtual machine or cloud server.
b. Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins for Git integration, pipeline support (e.g., Pipeline, Pipeline
GitHub, Pipeline Docker), and any additional tools required for your project.
c. Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.

2. Configure Version Control:

a. Set up a Git repository on GitHub or GitLab to host the web application code.
b. Create a sample web application (e.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node.js, Python Flask, etc.) and
push it to the Git repository.

3. Create Jenkins Pipeline:

a. Write a Jenkinsfile (declarative or scripted pipeline) to define the CI/CD stages:
i. Build Stage: Pull the code from the Git repository, compile/build the application.
ii. Test Stage: Run automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) on the built application.
iii. Deploy Stage: Package the application into a Docker container, push the container to Docker
Hub or a private registry, and deploy it to a test/staging environment.

4. Configure Docker:

a. Install Docker on the Jenkins server or a separate Docker host.
b. Create a Dockerfile to define the container environment and dependencies for your web application.
c. Set up Docker Hub or a private Docker registry for container storage.

5. Integrate Jenkins with GitHub/GitLab:

a. Configure Jenkins to trigger the pipeline automatically on code commits/merges to the Git
repository.
b. Add webhook or webhook-like functionality to receive notifications from the version control system.

6. Test and Validate:

a. Run the Jenkins pipeline manually or trigger it through a code commit to the Git repository.
b. Monitor the CI/CD pipeline execution in Jenkins, check for build/test failures, and troubleshoot any
issues.



Task2- # Terraform-task

Task Completion Report: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

1. Choose Cloud Provider:

a. Select a AWS cloud provider for the infrastructure deployment.
b. Set up an account and obtain necessary credentials (access keys, secret keys) for
Terraform.

2. Define Terraform Configuration:

a. Install Terraform on your local machine or a designated server.
b. Create a Terraform configuration file (main.tf) to define the cloud infrastructure resources
(e.g., virtual machines, load balancers, databases, networking components) required for the
web application.

3. Configure Terraform Variables:

a. Use Terraform variables to parameterize your configuration and make it reusable across
environments.
b. Define variables for cloud region, instance types, network settings, security groups, and
other resource attributes.

4. Provision Infrastructure:

a. Initialize the Terraform configuration using the

'terraform init'

command.

b. Plan the infrastructure changes using

'terraform plan

' to preview the resources that will be

created, modified, or destroyed.
c. Apply the Terraform configuration using

'terraform apply

' to provision the cloud resources

based on your defined configuration.

5. Manage Infrastructure State:

a. Store and manage Terraform state files securely (e.g., using remote state storage in AWS
S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud).
b. Use Terraform workspace management for multiple environments (dev, test, prod) and
version control with Git.

6. Validate Deployment:

a. Access the provisioned cloud resources through the cloud provider's console or command-
line interface.

b. Verify that the infrastructure is deployed correctly.
